## Stack description 💻
Project has two parts - back-end on ASP.NET Core MVC and front-end on ReactJs library.

The first one has a 3tier architecture:

- DAL (Data access layer)
- BLL (Business logic layer)
- UI (Here it is API Controllers layer)

Data is stored in the SQL Server database. EF6 was used to access the data.

Bootstrap was used in the front-end part.
